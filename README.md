# Fleabag Script Encoding Project

Welcome to this repository, dedicated to encoding excerpts from the script of the multi-award-winning television series *Fleabag*, written and created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge  This project encodes selected moments using XML following the TEI model, in order to explore how narrative and multimodal features can be represented digitally.

## Context

*Fleabag* is a television series based on the play of the same name. It tells the story of a woman living in London grappling with family, work,
sex, love and loss. The second series aired in the summer of 2019 to further critical acclaim. It is a love story." Then the full script was published in print by Ballantine Books in 2019.

I chose *Fleabag* because it stands as an exemplary piece of contemporary writing, structurally rich, emotionally layered, and formally inventive. It also holds personal meaning for me, as it is one of the truest depictions of what it means to be, as a woman, as a person.

## Sources

The published script divides the narrative only by episode. To meet the assignment’s length criteria and maintain narrative integrity, I defined shorter meaningful units extracted exclusively from **Season 2**, which maintains thematic and narrative coherence.

The selected excerpts are:

* **Excerpt 1 – Season 2, Episode 3 (Ending)**: Fleabag and the Priest share a quiet moment in his garden, discussing faith and fear.
* **Excerpt 2 – Season 2, Episode 4 (Ending)**: Fleabag delivers a confessional monologue about being lost, which leads to an intimate encounter with the Priest.
* **Excerpt 3 – Season 2, Episode 6 (Final Scene)**: The Priest says goodbye to Fleabag, and she says goodbye to us.

## Project Objectives

* **Digital Structuring**: Encoding with XML allows for a detailed structural representation of the dialogue, actions, and emotions within a multimodal work that blends theatre, television, and literature.
* **Scholarly Modeling**: The TEI-inspired schema supports the representation of both spoken and visual dimensions of performance texts.
* **Interpretive Focus**: The encoding highlights how text, performance, and direction interact to build meaning in *Fleabag*.

## Statement on AI

AI was used only as a conversational and brainstorming tool for structuring ideas. All conceptual, editorial, and encoding work was carried out independently as I do not belive in AI technical capacities.
