EXT. PRIEST’S HOUSE. GARDEN – NIGHT
FLEABAG
Do you think I should become a Catholic?
PRIEST
No, don’t do that. I like that you believe in a meaningless
existence. You’re good for me. You make me question my faith.
FLEABAG
And?
Beat.
PRIEST
I’ve never felt closer to God.
They laugh. She gives him a look. He laughs.
FLEABAG
Fuck you.
There is a rustle in a bush. The Priest is instantly terrified.
PRIEST
What was that? It wasn’t a fox, was it?
FLEABAG
I don’t know.
He stands up quickly.
PRIEST
Is it a fox? Shine something.
(into the night)
BOO. BAAA! Oh God, I bet it’s a fox.
Fleabag is laughing.
PRIEST
No, I’m not being funny, foxes have been after me for years. It’s
like they have a pact or something. I’m not kidding, I was on the
toilet. A TOILET of a TRAIN. And when the train stopped, a
fucking FOX tried to get through the window. OF A TRAIN. ITS
FACE WAS IN THE WINDOW.
Fleabag is laughing.
PRIEST
And once when I was at a monastery, I woke up just feeling a bit
weird like there might be a fox about and A FOX was sitting under
my window just looking up like this —
(beat)
— pointing at me like – you. We’re watching you. We’re having
you.
FLEABAG
Lucky God got there first.
PRIEST
Well yeah.
FLEABAG
You could be a fox boy by now.
PRIEST
And we all know what happens to them.
He tentatively sits back down.
Beat.
FLEABAG
Are you Ok?
PRIEST
I’m Ok.
(beat)
Do you think I’m mad?
FLEABAG
Because of the fox thing or because of the God thing?
He laughs.
PRIEST
You’re obsessed.
FLEABAG
Do you ever have doubts?
PRIEST
Sure, every day. It’s part of the deal.
FLEABAG
I just don’t think I could do it. Especially the —
He looks at her.
PRIEST
What?
FLEABAG
The celibacy thing.
There’s a rustle.
PRIEST
IT’S A FUCKING FOX.
FLEABAG
CHILL OUT ABOUT THE FOX.
PRIESTSorry. I just … don’t know what they want from me.
(beat)
I’m sorry. Celibacy. Go.
He smiles.
FLEABAG
I just couldn’t give up sex forever. It’s just too, it’s too —
PRIEST
Celibacy is a lot less complicated than romantic relationships.
FLEABAG
But what if you meet someone you like?
PRIEST
I talk and drink and laugh and give them bibles and hope they
eventually leave me alone.
FLEABAG
What if you meet someone you love?
They hold eye contact.
PRIEST
We’re not going to have sex.
Fleabag glances at the camera.
PRIEST
I know you think that’s what you want from me. But it’s not. It
won’t bring anything good.
They laugh, there’s a spark.
FLEABAG
Well, it might —
PRIEST
It won’t. I’ve been there many times. Before I found this. Many,
many times.
FLEABAG
How many times?
Beat.
PRIESTMany.
(beat)
I’d really like to be your friend though.
FLEABAG
I’d like to be your friend too.
(to camera)
We will last a week.
PRIEST
What was that?
FLEABAG
What?
PRIEST
Where did … Where did you just go?
FLEABAG
What?
PRIEST
You just went somewhere.
Fleabag looks at the camera in panic.
PRIEST
There. There. Where did you just go?
FLEABAG
Nowhere.
He looks at her, uncertain.
PRIEST
Ok …
Pause. He turns away. Fleabag looks at the camera. Where do we go from
here?
Suddenly a rustle in the bushes again – they both turn and jump in fear.
PRIEST/FLEABAG
AGH!!
END OF EPISODE 3


(end of episode 4)
FLEABAG
And I’m ashamed of not knowing what I—
PRIEST (O.S.)
Want? It’s Ok not to know what you want.
FLEABAG
No, I know what I want, I know exactly what I want, right now.
PRIEST (O.S.)
What’s that?
Pause.
FLEABAG
It’s bad.
PRIEST (O.S.)
That’s Ok.
FLEABAG
I want someone to tell me what to wear in the morning.
Pause.
PRIEST (O.S.)
Ok. Well I think there are people who can do that—
FLEABAG
No, I want someone to tell me what to wear every morning … I
want someone to tell me what to eat, what to like, what to hate,
what to rage about, what to listen to, what band to like, what to buy
tickets for, what to joke about, what not to joke about. I want
someone to tell me what to believe in, who to vote for, who to love
and how to … tell them.
(beat)
I just think I want someone to tell me how to live my life, Father,
because so far, I think I’ve been getting it wrong.
(beat)
And I know that is why people want people like you in their lives.
Because you just tell them how to do it. You just tell them what to
do. And what they’ll get out of the end of it. And even though I
don’t believe your bullshit and I know that scientifically nothing I
do makes any difference in the end anyway, I’m still scared, why
am I still scared?
(beat)
Just fucking tell me what to do, Father.
Silence.
She looks to the grate. She can’t make out his expression. A long pause.
PRIEST (O.S.)
Kneel.
Beat.
FLEABAG
What?
Beat.
PRIEST (O.S.)
Kneel.
Beat.
Fleabag is stunned.
Beat.
PRIEST (O.S.)
(gently)
Just kneel.
She kneels.
The curtain opens and he stands over her.
She looks up at him.
He kneels in front of her.
He gently takes her face in his hands.
They are breathing nervously.
He holds her face in front of his for a moment. Deciding.
She moves her lips forward and they kiss.
It’s a gentle, loving kiss. It’s nothing short of fucking beautiful.
They stop. They look at each other.
They kiss again.
They kiss more passionately.
It becomes more physical.
She starts hiking his skirts.
They grab at each other.
She gets him against the door of the confessional and keeps hiking his skirts
up.
She eventually gets underneath, but quickly discovers he also has trousers
on UNDER HIS SKIRT!
FLEABAG
Skirt and trousers?
PRIEST
Sorry.
They keep kissing. The passion builds and builds …
But then—
A painting of Jesus falls off the wall. It hits the church flagstones with a
crash.
They immediately stop. They both turn to look at it.
Beat.
Fleabag looks to the Priest. She tries to smile. He holds her gaze. Then
turns, mortified, and walks away from her. Out of the church.
She watches him go.
Beat.
She looks at us.
END OF EPISODE 4






(end of episode 6 the end)
EXT. LONDON. STREET. BUS STOP – NIGHT
Fleabag sits at the bus stop. She looks up the road.
He’s not there.
She looks up the road again. She smiles.
The Priest approaches.
FLEABAG
You nailed it.
He laughs. He sits. They look up at the screen. It’s 46 minutes until the next
bus.
PRIEST
Ugh. They always lie. It’ll magically come in a minute.
(beat)They’re really into each other, those two. It’s nice.
FLEABAG
They really pulled it off.
PRIEST
Was your sister Ok? She seemed —
FLEABAG
Yeah she – er – she – had to do a work thing …
PRIEST
— a bit on edge.
PRIEST
Wow, dedicated!
FLEABAG
Addicted.
They look at each other. Pause.
FLEABAG
It’s God, isn’t it?
Beat.
PRIEST
Yeah.
Fleabag smiles and nods.
FLEABAG
Damn.
(pause)
Damn.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
You know the worst thing is … That I fucking love you.
Beat.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
I love you.
Beat. He takes a breath, but she interrupts.
FLEABAGNo no don’t, let’s just leave that out there for a second on its own.
Beat.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
I love you.
They sit with the words.
Pause. She looks at him.
He takes her hand.
PRIEST
(gently)
It’ll pass.
Beat.
She smiles.
Beat.
FLEABAG
This bus is not magically coming.
PRIEST
(getting up)
I think I’ll walk.
FLEABAG
Ok.
PRIEST
See you Sunday?
She laughs.
PRIEST
I’m joking. You’re never ever allowed in my church again.
They laugh.
Beat.
PRIEST
I love you too.
(beat)Ok.
He turns and walks away.
Soon, he is gone.
Fleabag inhales sharply.
She looks up at the digital bus timer. It says: Cancelled.
Beat. Fleabag sits there.
After a few moments a FOX passes her in the middle of the road.
It stops and looks at her.
She points in the direction the Priest walked.
FLEABAG
He went that way.
The fox trots off after him.
Fleabag sits there.
She opens her bag and pulls out the STATUE.
She looks at it … Her golden mother, sat with her at a bus stop in the
middle of the night. Just the two of them.
She looks at us.
A hint of a smile.
She stands up, puts her bag over her shoulder and, holding the statue of her
mother in her hand, she turns to walk.
The camera moves with her for a couple of steps.
She stops, feeling it follow her. She looks at us. She smiles slightly with an
almost imperceptible shake of her head.
She’s asking us not to follow her.
She turns and walks again up the street.
The camera remains where it is.When she gets almost out of sight she turns and gives us a smile and a little
wave.
Then turns and walks off into the night.
Goodbye.
THE END.
